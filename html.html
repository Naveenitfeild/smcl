					What is HTML?
				</header>
				<p>
					HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications.
					 Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                   <br>
                  <b> Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                    <br>
                   <b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
					 Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                   HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <canvas> element, in collaboration with javascrip

					  Uses of Html
				</header><br>
				<p>
					<b>Web Pages Development:</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					To create the pages on the world wide web, HTML is used widely. Every page has HTML tags collection, including the hyperlinks, and these hyperlinks allow the users to go to the other pages, and we can say that these are used to connect the other pages.
					 Every page that we see on the internet is written in some form of HTML code.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Internet Navigation:</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					It is one of the important uses of HTML. And by using the hypertext concept, this navigation is possible. Basically, it is the text that links to other text or web pages. And the user is directed to the referenced text or website when the user clicks on it. HTML is used widely to incorporate hyperlinks inside web pages.
					 A user can move between web pages and websites that are located on various servers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> Web Document Creation:</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					A web document is divided into three sections: the title, the head, and the body. The information needed to identify the document, such as the title and any other significant keywords, is included in the head. And in the browser’s bar, the title can be seen, and the main portion, which is the website’s body section visible to the viewer. 
				</p>

				<header>
					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in html. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in html can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.
