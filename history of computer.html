    <center><h1>Evolution of Computers</h1></center>
    <p>Programming is the Implementation of logic to facilitate specified computing operations and functionality. <br> it occurs in one or more languages, which differ by application, domain and programming model.</p>
    <br>
      <center><img src="joseph-marie-.jpg"></center>
      <p>1801: <b>Joseph Marie Jacquard</b>, a French merchant and inventor invents a loom that uses punched wooden cards <br>to automatically weave fabric designs. Early computers would use similar punch cards.</p>
      <center><img src="Charles-Babbage-1871.jpg"></center>
      <p>1821:<b> English mathematician Charles Babbage </b>conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. Funded by the British government,<br> the project, called the "Difference Engine" fails due to the lack of technology at the time, according to the University of Minnesota.</p>
      <BR>
    <p>1848: Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and the daughter of poet Lord Byron, writes the world's first computer program. According to Anna Siffert, <br>a professor of theoretical mathematics at the University of Münster in Germany, Lovelace writes the first program while translating a paper on Babbage's Analytical Engine from French into English.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1853: Swedish inventor Per Georg Scheutz and his son Edvard design the world's first printing calculator. The machine is significant for being the first to "compute tabular differences and print the results," according to Uta C. Merzbach's book, "Georg Scheutz and the First Printing Calculator".</p>
    <br>
    <p>1890: Herman Hollerith designs a punch-card system to help calculate the 1890 U.S. Census. The machine,  saves the government several years of calculations, and the U.S. taxpayer approximately $5 million, according to Columbia University. </p>
    <br>

Turing machines are capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer is based on his ideas. Turing is later involved in the development of the Turing-Welchman Bombe, an electro-mechanical device designed to decipher Nazi codes during World War II, according to the UK's National Museum of Computing. </p>

    <br>
    <p>1946: Mauchly and Presper leave the University of Pennsylvania and receive funding from the Census Bureau to build the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer for business and government applications.</p>
